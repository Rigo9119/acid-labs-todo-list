# Acid Labs Front End test

This test is a very simple Todo list created with react, apart from the library
it uses CSS and PropTypes.

## Scafolding

You will find the structure for the test as: 

- src
    - components
        - FormInput
            * FormInput.jsx
            * FormInput.css
        - TodoItem
            * TodoItem.jsx
            * TodoItem.css
        - TodoList
            * TodoList.jsx
            * TodoList.css

## To run the project

* first download the repo
* install dependencies with yarn
```
yarn 
```
* run the project
```
yarn dev
```
* open your browser and the project will run on the port 3000

## Some improvements 

Well the app is small and implementing react hooks could been implemented in order 
to control the delete and add item states. Apart from that anything else should 
have been and overkilled.
